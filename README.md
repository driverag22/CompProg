# Competitive programming problem set

Just the set of competitive programming problems I have solved/am currently working on.

Pretty intuitive but:

* ./solved = solved problems
* ./in_process = problems which are _being_ solved 
* ./meh = problems which were started but proved to be too hard and were left to be solved later on

Don't hold me accountable for the code that you might see here.
